# Hi, I'm Bruce Stephenson 👋  
Software engineer • research tinkerer • building high-performance systems

I work at the intersection of **real-time simulation**, **game tooling**, and **mathematical engines**.  
Current focus: a full-featured **Traveller RPG Virtual Tabletop (VTT)** with real-time multiplayer, built from scratch.

## 🚀 Current Projects

---

### 🥼 Scientific work in Condensed Matter Physics - Statistical Mechanics ###

---

### 🔧 Traveller Combat VTT (Mongoose 2e)
A lightweight, fast, multiplayer VTT engine designed specifically for the Traveller RPG.  
Emphasis on:
- real-time sync
- deterministic resolution
- clean UI for GMs and players
- rule-accurate system implementation

👉 Repo: `traveller-combat-vtt`

---

### 🌊 QRR Marine Physics Engine
An experimental high-performance fluid dynamics toolkit using novel **Quantized Relational Relativity** mathematics.

👉 Repo: [qrr-marine-python](https://github.com/energyscholar/qrr-marine-python)
